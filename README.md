GIOS - Gaze-IO-System
==============

Goal
----
This project aims to enable desktop navigation and application control using user's eye gaze as an input using only the onboard webcam and in variable lighting conditions. To accomplish this, we are developing efficient accurate eye detection and 2D gaze estimation algorithms. We started out with analyzing existing algorithms in the domain and at present, have shifted to developing more time efficient derivatives. 

The 2D gaze estimation system will work as an input device that will interact and control the desktop environment by performing basic manipulations, like navigation, and application manipulation. Initially, the system will be targeted towards Linux based distros.
